# Quick Coding Challenge from Augmento

**Comments**
- Amount spent: about 3 hours
- Chose XBTUSD as data
- Wasn't sure about stationarity of the return data (assumed percentage change)
- Data not uploaded

**Comments ver2**
-  I spent another 2-3 hours to play with data
-  Used close price this time and did a correlation with another ratio
-  Better outcome
-  Couldn't push it until now because on a train to Warsaw (no internet)
